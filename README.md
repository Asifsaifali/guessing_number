# ðŸŽ® Rust + WebAssembly Guessing Game

A simple "Guess the Number" game written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly using `wasm-pack`. It features a clean, animated frontend built with HTML and CSS.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Rust generates a secret number using `rand`
- WebAssembly exposes two functions: `start_game` and `check_guess`
- Frontend interacts with these using JavaScript
- UI is animated and responsive, with bounce effect on win ðŸ¥³

---

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- Rust & Cargo
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
- Python 3 (for local server)
- WSL or Linux/Unix recommended for building
